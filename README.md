# Drowsiness-Detector
This is a real time sleep detector!

# Working


This application can detect a person eyes and apply a mathematical formula on it tell if a person is asleep or not.
Blinking is doesnot come under sleeping :D 

I take images of a person in a intervals of 20ms.

This application will work for multiple faces in a frame also. Guess what I can catch students sleeping in a class!.

I have taken the help of libraries such as numpy,cv2,dlib
